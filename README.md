# What Do We Learn?
If your website needs a search suggestion system that implements Vue frontend, and FastAPI backend and needs a faster suggestion system, this repository will help you understand the concept or use it as it is or modify as you need. The marisa_trie library is optimized for faster prefix searches. I'll add other examples for substring and suffix searches later.

# Trie Tree Use Case Scenario
* Website search suggestion
* Location suggestion
* Searching files from a large list of files in a folder faster when you need to search multiple times again and again

# Libraries installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
